##### Masters of Renaissance

** Lapo Falcone - Marco Fumagalli - Sofia Guggiari **

#### Tools to run the game

In order to run the game you should use a Windows 10 machine with Java 11 installed and configured as default java runtime.
To run the CLI in the intended way you should install [this]() terminal or use the Git Bash, since ANSI color codes are not supported anymore in latest versions of Windows cmd or PowerShell. Using the CLI in cmd or Powershell is still possible, but it is not recommended, since colors are fundamental in our implementation of the CLI.

#### How to run the game

In order to run the game, launch `deliverables/MastersOfRenaissance.jar`. A simple menu will pop up, where you can choose what component to run. `savedMatches.txt` and `MastersOfRenaissance.jar` must be in he same folder for the game to work.

### Server
When launching the server, a message asking you what port number you want to use will pop up. If you enter an invalid value, the default port (14009) will be chosen.
After the server has been launched, it will start logging the events it polls from the specified port, such as players connections, disconnections and matches creation.
By typing `CTRL + C` in the terminal, the server will shut down, and all of the active matches will be saved and restored next time the server is launched. In the unlikely case of server disconnection, match won't be saved, since the server isn't able to detect if the disconnection happened due to client disconnection or server disconnection.
If all of the players in a match get disconnected, the server will instantaneously delete that match. If at least one player in the match is active the server will keep the match alive, and it will skip turns of disconnected players.
If a player disconnects, it can reconnect to the match by using the same name and match ID. This mechanism doesn't ensure that the same physical person actually reconnects to the match.
In case of server failure (not disconnection), all of the players will be kicked from the match, and they can reconnect to the same match, when the server is up again, by using the same name and match ID. The first player to reconnect will be the first to play, so, if you are playing with friends, we suggest that the player who was playing before the disconnection is the first to reconnect.
A server can host as many games as the host memory allows, by specifying different match IDs. Players can have the same name, as long as they are playing in different matches (different match IDs).

In conclusion, the server implements 3 bonus points:
* Multiple matches
* Players disconnections
* Server failure resilience

### GUI
## Home screen
The home screen of the GUI presents 4 text fields and 2 buttons:
* **Name**: the name of the player. It cannot contain spaces and it is tested to contain only English alphabet letters and numbers. Some names are reserved, if you choose one of these names and try to create a match, you will be told.
* **Server IP**: the IPv4 address of the server to connect to. "localhost" is also allowed for local matches.
* **Server port**: the port number of the server. It defaults to 14009, but it can be changed based on the server configuration.
* **Match ID**: the ID of the match to connect to. If ID doesn't exist on the server, a new match will be created.
* **Play**: asks the server to create a new multiplayer match, or to connect to an existing multiplayer match.
* **Single player**: asks the server to create a single player match (against Lorenzo).

If you got disconnected and try to reconnect, 'Play' and 'Single player' will do the same thing, and the only criteria to choose between a single player of multiplayer match, is the match ID (whether is was a single player or multiplayer match before the disconnection).

## Lobby
In the lobby screen, a list of players will show up. Each player has an associated colour:
* **Blue**: match leader, is the only player that can press `Start`.
* **Green**: connected player.
* **Red**: disconnected player.

If the leader exits the match, a new leader will be choosen.

## Pre match
In the pre match screen you can choose your leaders and starting resources. By hoovering on the `Show table` button, you can check the status of the marketplace and development grid, in order to choose wisely your starting items.

## Match
# Leaders
Click on an inactive leader to choose whether to activate or discard it.

# Move items
Click on an item to select it. All of the depots that can receive that item will be highlighted. Click on an highlighted depot to move the selected item there, or click a void area to disable the selection.

# Swap warehouse rows
Click on a counter-arrows icon near the row, then click on another counter-arrow icon to invert the 2 rows, or click a void area to disable the selection. If the swap isn't possible you will be told.

# Produce
To activate productions, select them with the relative tick-box. To produce, click the `Produce` button. All of the selected productions will produce. Of course, in order to produce, you must place the perfect amount of items on each active production. If this condition isn't matched, you will be told.

# Buy marbles
Click on `Marketplace`, select one row or column using the arrows. Click on a marble, then click on the depot where you want to store it. Click on a white marble to color it (if you have the right leader). During the process of marble acquisition, items cannot be moved, but warehouse rows can be swapped. So, if you have a leader the can store items, we strongly suggest you to place as many marbles as you can in the leader depots, before using the warehouse depots. When you are done, discard remaining marbles (even if 0 marbles remains). During the discard process you will be awarded the faith points for the red marble (if any).

# Buy cards
To buy a card, you must place the correct amount of resources into the paycheck. As you can see, the paycheck has 2 numbers for each item. The first number represents the amount of resources in the paycheck coming form the strongbox, the second one the amount of resources coming from the warehouse/leaders depots.

# Spy opponents
You can hoover over the players placeholders in the faith track to spy them.
_Known bug: If you are hoovering over a player, and you become the active player in that exact moment, the dashboard of the player you were spying will remain visible. To hide it simply hoover again on that player placeholder in the fath track._
